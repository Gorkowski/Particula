    "\n",
    "The distribution strategies, define how to calculate properties derived from the particle distribution. These include particle mass, radius, and total mass. All of which can have different methods depending if the distribution is mass-based, radius-based, or speciated-mass based.\n",

    "- `SpeciatedMassMovingBin`\n",
    "\n",
    "As they are just operational strategies, they do not have any specific parameters to be set. They are just used to calculate the properties of the particles."
