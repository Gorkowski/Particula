# Feature Prioritization

## Particle Resolved

- [ ] Coagulation needs to be implemented
- [ ] fix density broadcast for radius in speciated mass calc

## Continuous Particle PDF and PMF

- [ ] Bin Remapping after condensation and evaporation is needed
- [ ] Coagulation needs to be checked for PMF vs PDF handling

## Scavenging

- [ ] Scavenging needs to be implemented for Particle Resolved

## Activity Coefficients

- [ ] BAT model needs added to activity coefficient calculation
